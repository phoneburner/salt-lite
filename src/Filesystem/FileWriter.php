/**
 * Atomic file writing utility
 *
 * In order to avoid a potential race condition between multiple execution
 * threads trying to write a new file to the same local memory location
 * when the file does not exist, and ending up with an unparsable "broken" file,
 * we first write to a temporary file and then rename (i.e. `mv`) it to the
 * actual file. Since we're renaming a file on the same file system and in
 * the same directory, this should be an atomic operation and avoid permissions
 * issues. If multiple threads try to do this simultaneously, the last write
 * wins, while any attempts to read the file during the rename operation will
 * be successful using the file-to-be-overwritten.
