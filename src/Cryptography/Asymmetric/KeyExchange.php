/**
 * The ECDH+Blake2b key exchange algorithm supports the creation of four distinct
 * shared keys, based on which party is the "server" and which is the "client",
 * and whether the keys are used for transmitting or receiving information from
 * the other party. The client/server roles are arbitrary and can be reversed,
 * as long as both parties agree on which role they are playing, this makes
 * the key exchange algorithm suitable for use in a wide variety of scenarios,
 * especially for back-and-forth communication between two parties.
 *
 * For our more typical use cases, we only care about the encrypting party computing
 * the same shared secret as the decrypting party, without concern for who is
 * acting in what role. We expose a simplified API for this use case, where only
 * with the `encryption` and `decryption` methods, which still allow for distinct
 * directional keys, but do not require the caller to specify the client/server roles.
 *
 * Note: Since X25515 scalar multiplication produces a group element, not a
 * uniformly distributed key, the shared-secret is passed through the Blake2b
 * hash function, concatenated with the two public keys.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * Let p.n be the crypto_scalarmult_curve25519_BYTES byte output of the X25519
 * key exchange operation. The 512-bit output of BLAKE2B-512 is split into two
 * 256-bit keys rx and tx:
 *      rx || tx = BLAKE2B-512(p.n || client_pk || server_pk)
